# CSS Grid and Flexbox

With CSS Grid and Flexbox, you can create some very unique page layouts with minimal effort. Before Grid and Flexbox, you created multi-column layouts using `width` and `float`. Or centered logos with text using `margin` or some sort of positioning.

You'll find out that some of those past solutions can be done in a more elegant way using just a few lines of CSS.


## Assignment

Below are some wireframes from the CSS Fundamentals assignment. You should be referencing these wireframes when working on the assignment. Your job is to recreate these webpages using CSS Grid for your layout and Flexbox when needed.

You should not be using `float`, `position`, `margin` or any other means to create these layouts.

## Requirements
- Create a "homepage" (named `index.html`) following the wireframe provided (see below)
- Create an internal pages following the wireframe provided (see below)
- Every page must include...
  - A title, description
  - A reset stylesheet
  - A custom external stylesheet
- Your external stylesheet must have comments separating the different sections of the webpage (header, content, 
  footer, typography, etc.)


How you structure your webpages and stylesheets is up to you. Just make sure that your classes and ids make sense. Remember, classes can be reused and should be _generic_ in nature. While ids must be unique and should be 
specific to "identify" an element on a webpage.

As for the page content, be creative. Create a mini website for any topic of your choice. Lorem ipsum is fine, however I find it more enjoyable creating a project based on an interest you have.

### Recommended Stucture

How you structure your website is up to you, however, the following structure is strongly recommended. Placing all file types into their own directory keeps your files organized.

```
|__ index.html
|__ internal-page.html
|__ css
   |__ styles.css
   |__ reset.css
```

## Wireframes
