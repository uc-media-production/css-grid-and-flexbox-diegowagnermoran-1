        <h1>The Hero of the Wild Series</h1>
        <p>Yeah I know that these are two video games and theyre also the newest. But guess what? I DONT CARE!!! It's my list and I'm literally just doing this to fill up space and entertain you instead of doing lorem ipsum. (also I wasnt sure if I was allowed to put 5 cards on index instead of 4, so I'm playing it safe here because im really trying to pass this class and graduate. But yeah I honestly think both of these games feel incomplete without each other (you cannot tell me the ending of BOTW didn't feel a little abrupt, like they were definitely gunning for a sequel. Like I said at some point in index page, I love the Zelda franchise because I like making up my own narratives while playing video games to motive me to play, and these two games are just so perfect for this. Sure the npcs arent as in depth as something like the new baldurs gate, but man oh man do i love exploring in these two games. Like, I just love their attention to subtle details, like the wind blowing the grass and leaves around you, animals interacting with each other, the sound of the rain, the way the air makes noise as you fall or glide through it. Just so so awesome. And also, I'm just gonna go ahead and contradict myself here, Totk has some amazing NPCs. They're so charming and I love how there more dynamic than ever (i remember meeting a family in a rain storm who were refugees from Lurelin village, going to lurelin village and beating out the pirates, and when the family came back to the town, they referred to the time that they met me in the rainstorm. That made my day when that happened. Anyways yeah dope pair of games here, the lack of dungeons doesnt really bother me, because i can create my own excitement and challenges as much as I like</p>
