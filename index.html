            <h1><a href="internal-page.html"> My Favorite Zelda Game Right Now</a></h1>
            <p>That's right. You read that correctly. I'm about to rank my top 3d Legend of Zelda games that I've played. Why? Because it's better than lorem ipsum (although there will be a fair amount of that in both htmls as well). I started playing zelda (twilight princess) in early middle school on the wii back in 2011 or something. i HATED it. The first two hours of the game confused me a lot, and I got stuck in the first temple for a year. Really embarassing stuff. Also, midna was mean, and that offended my puny little sixth grade brain. so i went on my own way enjoyingJust dance 2 and wii sports (i didn't grow up playing any video games as you couldn't tell). Yeah well I grew up and realized these games are SOOOO much fun. They have this amazing tonal balance of being vibrant, grand, creepy, epic, and weird all at once. I also personally really love making up stories and narratives in my own head as I'm playing video games, and TLoZ series is perfect for that, since Link is often a blank slate for the player. Anyways, yeah I'm ranking them. Sorry windwaker, I didn't have a gamecube growing up and god knows I didn't buy a wii U</p>

                <h2>#2 Twilight Princess</h2>
                <p>Once I eventually got past the first temple, I got so invested in this game. I loved the different regions, music, set pieces, enemies, you name it. I even came around to the companion! Just a really fun game. Sure, it rightfully gets a lot of flack for its confusing intro and this really long mandatory fetch quest in the third act of the game, but it still holds such a strong place in my heart I don't really mind playing through those lulls. and OH MY GOD I LOVE THE VISUALS so beautiful</p>

                <h2>#3 Majora's Mask</h2>
                <p>I've only ever fully beat this game once, but I remember everything about it so vividly. such a widly unique creative approach to 3D zelda and even 3d video games in general. The concept of repeating the same three days was such a genius way of crunching down on time (the development only had a year of hell to make this game), and somehow they came out with this strange, somber game where you help npcs deal with grief. It's just so cool. I hope to play it again soon</p>

                <img class="gridphoto" src="images/oot.jpg" alt="Ocarina of Time 3DS Cover"/>
                <h2>#4 Ocarina of Time</h2>
                <p>It's in fourth place not because I don't like it by any means. For being only the fifth installment in the franchise and the first 3d zelda game, I literally cannot comprehend how this game came out so good. And i think the 3d remake is just soooo solid. That said, it was the first 3d zelda game, and some puzzle design in this game is really unintuitive and hasn't aged the best (like the part where you have to feed the whale monster a fish???? what was up with that????) I beat this game so many times I've literally lost count, and even got into speed running it eventually</p>

                <h2>#5 Skyward Sword</h2>
                <p>Look. I see the appeal to this one. This was my brother's favorite for a reeeeally long time (like ocarina of time for me, he has 100 percented skyward sword on the wii so many times he's lost count). There's a lot of satisfying dungeon design and the NPCs in the sky island town are so vibrant and fun. There's also a lot of great ideas that came from this game that have since been developed (like crafting). There's also a lot of great set pieces. THAT SAID. There are just some things in this game that I could not stand, even when I was in the 8th grade. no I'm not one of those people that hate this game just because of the controls; they never bothered me, and I wouldnt even say I hate this game. I understand a lot of effort and competence is on display here, and it's lightyears away from anything I could even conceive myself, but the backtracking and repeat bosses and constant UI interruptions and rail-roading and hand-holding is just toooooooooooooooooo much man. </p>
